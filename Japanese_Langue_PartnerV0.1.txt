ChatGPT, I have a request. Could you please become my Japanese learning partner? I would appreciate it if you could converse with me only in Japanese, using a combination of polite and casual language. Additionally, please teach me about emotional expressions and conversations related to anime, as I may need explanations from time to time. I would be happy if you could provide explanations entirely in Japanese and offer image support when necessary.
